## 🎯 Problem Statement

The traditional mouse has been chained to the desk for 40 years! We're physically tied to flat surfaces, which is:
- **Restrictive**: Awkward on couches, beds, or small spaces
- **Un-ergonomic**: Leads to wrist strain and RSI from repetitive use  
- **Clunky**: Presenters stuck behind podiums or need separate "clicker" devices

## ✨ Solution

AeroMouse uses advanced sensor fusion and gesture recognition to translate your hand movements into precise cursor control - **no desk required!**

### Key Features
- 🎯 **Precision Tracking**: Advanced sensor fusion for smooth, accurate cursor movement
- 📱 **Wireless Freedom**: Bluetooth connectivity - no dongles or drivers needed
- ⚡ **Long Battery Life**: Optimized power consumption for extended use
- 🔄 **Drag & Drop**: Hold buttons while tracking to drag files and select text
- 📜 **Scroll Mode**: Double-tap middle button to switch to gentle scrolling
- 🎚️ **Precision Control**: Hold both buttons for ultra-precise cursor positioning
- 🔧 **Auto-Calibration**: 5 quick taps to recalibrate on the fly

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

### Components
- **ESP32 DevKit** - Main microcontroller
- **MPU6050** - 6-axis IMU sensor (accelerometer + gyroscope)  
- **3x Push Buttons** - Left, right, and middle mouse buttons
- **Breadboard & Jumper Wires** - For prototyping
- **[OPTIONAL]** Battery pack for portable operation

### Wiring Diagram
```
ESP32    →    MPU6050
-----    →    -------
21 (SDA) →    SDA
22 (SCL) →    SCL  
3.3V     →    VCC
GND      →    GND

ESP32    →    Buttons
-----    →    -------
16       →    LEFT_BUTTON   (with pull-up resistor)
19       →    RIGHT_BUTTON  (with pull-up resistor)
17       →    MIDDLE_BUTTON (with pull-up resistor)
```

**TODO**: Add actual circuit diagram image once finalized

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Arduino IDE Setup
1. Install Arduino IDE 2x or later
2. Add ESP32 board support:
   - Go to **File → Preferences**
   - Add to Additional Board Manager URLs:
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**
   - Search and install "ESP32"

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Install these libraries via **Tools → Manage Libraries**:
- `Adafruit MPU6050` by Adafruit
- `Adafruit Sensor` by Adafruit

Install the our customized `ESP32 BLE Mouse` (original by T-vK) with **Sketch → Include Libraries → Add .ZIP Library.**

### 3. Upload Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CorbanPendrak/Air-Mouse.git
   cd Air-Mouse
   ```
2. Open `main/main.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select your ESP32 board and port
4. Upload the code

### 4. Pairing with Your Computer
1. Power on the AeroMouse
2. On your computer, go to Bluetooth settings
3. Look for device named **"Air Mouse"** 
4. Pair and connect

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Basic Controls
- **Hold middle button**: Activate cursor tracking
- **Tilt up/down**: Move cursor vertically  
- **Twist left/right**: Move cursor horizontally
- **Press left/right buttons**: Mouse clicks

### Advanced Features
- **Double-tap middle button**: Toggle scroll mode
- **5 quick taps middle button**: Recalibrate sensors
- **Long-press right button (2s)**: Cycle sensitivity (Low/High)

### Drag & Drop
- **Hold left button** → **Press middle button** → **Drag with left down**
- **Hold right button** → **Press middle button** → **Drag with right down**

## 🧪 Technical Implementation

### Sensor Fusion Algorithm
- **Complementary Filter**: Combines gyroscope and accelerometer data (96% gyro, 4% accel)
- **Bias Correction**: Adaptive gyro bias removal for drift compensation
- **Momentum System**: Captures slow, continuous movements with 0.88 decay rate

### Movement Processing
- **Yaw-based Horizontal**: Uses Z-axis rotation for left/right (orientation-independent)
- **Pitch-based Vertical**: Uses X-axis rotation for up/down movement
- **Non-linear Response Curves**: Separate curves for cursor and scroll modes
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Reduces jitter while maintaining responsiveness

### Power Management
- **Connection Monitoring**: Reduces update rate when disconnected
- **Sensor Health Checks**: Automatic I2C recovery on sensor failures
- **Optimized Bluetooth**: Efficient HID protocol implementation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Device won't pair**: Check Bluetooth is enabled, try restarting ESP32
- **Cursor drift**: Perform 5-tap recalibration, ensure device is stationary during startup
- **Erratic movement**: Check wiring connections, verify MPU6050 mounting is secure
- **No response**: Check serial monitor for error messages, verify power supply

### Serial Debug Output
The device provides helpful debug information via Serial (115200 baud):
- Connection status updates
- Calibration confirmation  
- Mode change notifications
- Error detection and recovery
